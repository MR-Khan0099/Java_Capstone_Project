# Vehicle Charging Station Simulation
## Overview
This project simulates an electric vehicle (EV) charging station system, designed to manage the charging process of electric cars in a simulated environment. It incorporates various components such as car queue management, energy source management based on weather conditions, a graphical user interface for monitoring the charging process, and handling potential exceptions related to charging.

## Components
- Car.java: Defines the Car class, representing the electric vehicles that will be charged at the station.
- CarQueue.java: Manages a queue of cars waiting to be charged, encapsulating the logic for adding and removing cars from the queue.
- ChargingExceptions.java: Contains custom exceptions that might occur during the charging process, such as errors related to energy source or queue management.
- ChargingStation.java: The core class that simulates the charging station, managing charging slots, and coordinating the charging process of cars in the queue.
- ChargingStationGUI.java: Provides a graphical user interface to visualize the charging station's operation, showing the status of each charging slot and the cars being charged.
- EnergyManagement.java: Manages the energy source for the charging station, which could vary based on external factors like weather conditions.
- Main.java: The entry point of the simulation, setting up the charging station, initializing the components, and starting the simulation.
- Weather.java: Simulates weather conditions that might affect the energy management for the charging station.


## Car.java
- Constructor(s): Initializes a new instance of a Car, likely with attributes such as license plate number, battery status, or owner details.
- Getters/Setters: Methods to access and modify the car's attributes, such as getting the license plate or battery level.
## CarQueue.java
- addCar(Car car): Adds a car to the queue, preparing it for charging.
- getNextCar(): Retrieves and removes the next car in the queue to be charged.
- getQueueSize(): Returns the current number of cars waiting in the queue.
## ChargingExceptions.java
Custom Exception Classes: 
- Defines various exceptions like QueueFullException, ChargingFailureException, etc., to handle specific error scenarios related to the charging process.
## ChargingStation.java
- startChargingProcess(): Initiates the charging process for cars. It may loop through the available charging slots and assign cars from the queue to each slot for charging.
- chargeCar(int slot): Handles the charging logic for a single car at a given charging slot. This includes updating the GUI, managing the energy source, simulating the charging duration, and logging the charging completion.
## ChargingStationGUI.java
- updateChargingSlot(int slot, String status): Updates the GUI component representing a charging slot with the current status, such as occupied, charging, or available.
- displayQueueStatus(List<Car> queue): Optionally, shows the status of the queue, including cars waiting to be charged.
## EnergyManagement.java
- getCurrentEnergySource(): Determines and returns the current energy source for charging, which could be influenced by external factors like the weather.
- adjustEnergySource(Weather weather): Adjusts the energy source based on the current weather conditions, optimizing for efficiency and sustainability.
## Main.java
- main(String[] args): The main method that sets up the simulation environment, initializes all components, and starts the charging station simulation.
## Weather.java
- getCurrentWeather(): Returns the current weather conditions, which may affect the energy management in the charging station.
